# Introduction
This is a written account of my attempt to compile WRF4.2 as of 1/22/2025.  
This follows the official WRF tutorial found [HERE](https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/OnLineTutorial/compilation_tutorial.php), but also includes photos and any tips or troubles I run into.  
Important Note: I am compiling this on a system that has all of the necessary libraries such as GNU gcc and foretran already installed.  

# Tars
The first step is to prepare your tars and get your files in order.  
To get the WRF compilation tar, you can visit [THIS](https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF/releases) github.
