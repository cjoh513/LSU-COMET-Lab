Running a simulation is easy, but in a efficient way is complex, specially when you have to run a simulations for dust that is comming from Africa until Puerto Rico or other places in America. Mostly of the times this domains are rectangular instead of square (which WRF love).

For this reason is important not to run with the same processors for x and y, because in this case the domains are rectangular. When you select to run with 16 cores, WRF is going to split 4 for x (nproc_x = 4) and 4 for y (nproc_y), because 4 is the square root of 16.

For example, we have this domains

```sh
&domains
 max_dom                             = 3
 e_we                                = 221, 65, 57
 e_sn                                = 61, 45, 37
```
In this example I had to run just with 4 processors, but we can use more.

We have to have in  mind the next

1) For each processor WRF needs no less than 10 grids per cell
2) If you select a nproc_x and nproc_y, these processors are going to be for the whole 3 domains

Based on the previous rule, the minimum value fow e_we (that is related with x or nproc_x) is 57, where the tens are 5 and the minimum value for e_sn (that is related with y or nproc_y) is 37, where the tens are 3. That means that the best idea to chose the processor is

 nproc_x  = 5,
 nproc_y  = 3,

Which as result is using 15 processors

But, if we want to be more eficient you can aproximate the values to the next tens

```sh
&domains
 max_dom                             = 3
 e_we                                = 221, 65, 60
 e_sn                                = 61, 45, 40
```
In this way you can use

 nproc_x  = 6,
 nproc_y  = 4,

Which as result is using 24 processors
